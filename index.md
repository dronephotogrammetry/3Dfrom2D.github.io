## Getting 3D from 2D for Australian Vegetation
This is a personal blog about my experiences with modelling vegetation using drone acquired imagery. While there are many publications on northern hemisphere forests Australian native forests contain features that don't adhere to the basic requirements of photogrammetry.
## Open data for testing
Structure from Motion and dense matching algorithms are complex, often proprietary and involve many computational assumptions that are made sequentially through the processing workflow. It is difficult therefore to compare like for like unless very detailed workflows and parameters are provided. The first steps of drone based photogrammetry seeks to match unique features created by an image segmentation algorithm based on colour, texture and other imagery attributes. It should therefore be expected that environmental conditions that alter illumination such as cloud and solar elevation/azimuth will result in different features being registered. Further, different software will use different algorithms to create unique features. Broadscale agriculture has seen a number of dedicated systems for routine processing of crop focused imagery sets. However, more complex features such forest canopies will will introduce variable occlusion of features particularly ground and tree structural components.
